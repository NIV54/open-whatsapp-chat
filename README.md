Tiny project for tinkering with `svelte.js` and `tailwind css`.  
I wanted to create something useful that focuses on UX, and will somewhat resemble a real app component.

## Stack

Svelte as the main js framework, and for transitions
Tailwind for styling

## Scripts

* Development - `npm run dev`
* Production - `npm run build` then serve your app (for example `serve public`)
